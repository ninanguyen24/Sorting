1. MyString: Create a "special" UCASEstring CLass, derived from <string>, 
such that UCASEstrings change all the comparison operators (<, <=, >, >=, ==)
to compare an upper case version of the string for sorting purposes. For the normal C++ string
("Apple" < "app") is true because "A" is upper case. When both are change to all upper case, then
("APP" < "APPLE") because "APP" is shorter. Best shown by a shorting demo.

2. Sort: Write a generic function for sorting.
